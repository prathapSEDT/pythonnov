'''
slicing is the concept of cropping sequence of elements
to crop the sequence of elements we need to specify the range in [ ]
synatx: [starting position: length]
here length is optinal, if we wont specify it, the compiler will crop the whole sequence
form the starting position
'''
# from index 3 get all the elements
print(myList[3:])

# from index 3 get exactly one element
print(myList[3:4])

# from index 3 get exactly two elements
print(myList[3:5])
